*Do not use this code!*

This is some benchmarking code I wrote several years ago and came back
to a few times, in support of [a blog post I finally published].  One
of the reasons I delayed finishing that post so long was that I
realized *the methodology used here is flawed*.  It's enough for us to
make a (weak) point, but shouldn't be taken seriously.

I'll do something like this again soon, and hopefully that will set a
better example.

There is both a Makefile that will do things, and a Python program
(`run-experiment.py`) that will do similar things.  The Makefile is
broken but convenient.  Many of the options for programs here don't
actually do anything.

You have been warned.
